# UnresolvedExpression class

Declarations aren't resolved until they're requierd, and their resolution order matters for variable resolution. This internal class is used to store any required data, and to allow for `instanceof` detection. 

**Signature:**

```typescript
export declare class UnresolvedExpression 
```
