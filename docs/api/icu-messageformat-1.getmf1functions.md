Build a [MessageFormat](./messageformat.messageformat.md) runtime to use with ICU MessageFormat 1 messages.

The structure of this runtime and the options available for its formatters follow the MF1 specifications, rather than being based on the MF2 default runtime.

**Signature:**

```typescript
getMF1Functions: () => {
    date: typeof date;
    duration: typeof duration;
    number: typeof number;
    time: typeof time;
}
```
